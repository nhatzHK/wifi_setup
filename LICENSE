You're free to use this while I like you. As soon as I tell you clearly that 
you're no longer on the list of people/organisations/etc that I like, you
should cease using this forever.

If this simple contract is violated, I reserve the rights to rreact however I
choose to at any moment. The possible reactions includes but are not restricted
to killing your cat(s), your dog(s), installing any version of Windows on your
computer(s) as well aliasing simple commands to `rm -rf` in you (shell)rc file.
You have been warned.
